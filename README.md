Arduino library for Hapkit 3.0
==============================

This is a library to interface with [Stanford's Hapkit 3.0](http://hapkit.stanford.edu/) device without the Seed's custom PCB. Instead the library can be used with genuine Arduino boards equipped with a motor shield. The library is primarily developed for Arduino Uno R3 with Adafruit Motor Shield v1.0 (yes, ancient one) and STM32 Nucleo.

Most of the code is based on the original code provided with the online Stanford's [Introduction to Haptics](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/SelfPaced/Haptics/2014/about) course taught by Prof. Allison Okamura.

The library being developed as a part of the course project on Physical Computing 2018 at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Switzerland.
